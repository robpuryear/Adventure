  storyText: 'The Large Cavern


    The adventurers traverse the tunnel past the cave opening, until it opens into
    a large cavern. The large cavern is empty of living creatures, although several
    lanterns around the room provide light. Rubble is piled up three feet high in
    several places throughout the cavern, and two tunnels lead out. The tunnel on
    the south wall is clear, but the tunnel to the east is chocked with debris. Dust
    still rides the zephyrs circulating through the cavern, leading you to believe
    the cave-in to the east was recent. '
